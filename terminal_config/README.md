# What's your .bashrc or .bash_profile
Do you have a custom ~/.bash_profile or .bashrc? Share it with us.

## What are .bash_profile and .bashrc?
Every time you log into a linux machine ether through SSH or by logging in via the terminal it finds a config file called .bash_profile which is located in your home directory. By customising your .bash_profile, you can customise your console experience. If you don't login via the terminal then the .bashrc is used instead of the .bash_profile to style your terminal experience.
**For OSX the .bash_profile and .bashrc have been merged into .bash_profile**
 
## How to modify a .bash_profile or .bashrc file
In Terminal, type:
.bash_profile: 	`nano ~/.bash_profile`
.bash_profile: 	`nano ~/.bashrc`
